            <p class="guideParagraph">Under attack? Parry! Pressing F on your keyboard will initiate a parry. If you are hit by an enemy during a brief time window after pressing F, you will take no damage and recover some posture. If you continue holding F, you will enter a blocking state. Getting hit while blocking will not deal damage to you, but your posture will be filled up. When your posture reaches its limit, your guard will be broken and you will take damage. <br> <br> Missing a parry will initiate a cooldown where pressing F will only cause you to block. A successful parry however, will remove this cooldown, effectively letting you beat any foe as long as you stay calm!</p>

        <article class="guideDodge">
            <p class="guideParagraph">Certain attacks are too fierce to be parried. When the red warning eye-con displays itself, get ready to time a dodge! These attacks are often much more powerful than those you can parry, so be careful to not get hit! Dodging has a much longer cooldown than parrying, which effectively makes this method of defence useless during most enemy attacks. Only dodge if you have to!</p>

            <p class="guideParagraph">When an opportunity presents itself, attack! Left-clicking with your mouse will initiate a basic attack with your equipped weapon. This attack deals light damage, but is guaranteed to hit your enemy as long as you aim it correctly. <br> <br> In the abyss, you might find powerful artifacts that grant you strange powers. Some of these will grant you offensive abilities, giving you more flexibility in combat. However, every attack has strengths and weaknessess. Learning when to shoot your gun and when to toss out a magic ability is key!</p>
